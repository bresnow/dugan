      "Kevin has helped hundreds of federal employees across the Ohio Valley plan their retirements over the last several years. Prior to being a financial planner, he worked as a health insurance broker, where he enabled people to make better decisions with their medical benefits. In 2007, Kevin graduated Cum Laude with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Economics and a minor in Mathematics from Loyola University Maryland. Kevin and his long-time business partner, Wayne Brown, now operate their own company with a shared vision of helping as many federal employees as possible.",
