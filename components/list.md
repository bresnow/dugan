<!-- Core Values [Content Clean Up]
 
Colors should be as follows:
                  i.      Integrity - dark blue

                 ii.      service - yellow

               iii.      excellence - 0bdeae

               iv.      mindfulness - purple -->

 
<!-- Replace the Mindfulness paragraph with this and get rid of the awkward break in the middle with the spinning check mark. Make it flow as two paragraphs.
                  i.      With Mindfulness in place as the final component of our core values, we promote the ideal that everything should be done with a vigorous amount of conscientiousness, keeping our foundational principles at the forefront of every interaction and bringing us just a tiny bit closer to our lofty vision for a world. -->

 

General Updates

We want to try the favicon in black instead of gold.
Could use a little less spacing/buffer between sections on each page.
<!-- The breadcrumb trail menu is still on each page. -->
```Google search on mobile for our site, comes up with an image of a black/white house instead of our actual logo.```
<!-- On the Core Values page, the images for excellence and mindfulness are identical. -->
On the About page, link to our mission and vision in the places that it mentions them.
 

Mobile Updates
<!-- 
?Federal Retirement Experts? is cut off on each page at the top-left. -->
```The menu in top-right does not function on any pages but the home page.?``` 
I'm trying to recreate this menu bug but im not seeing anything. I'll troubleshoot. Its probably something small.


<!-- The sidebar menu has old, nonsense info (phone number, support email). -->
<!-- About page, Wayne?s and Kevin?s headshots are a larger size than the other three headshots. -->
<!-- About page, the main menu is dropped below the breadcrumb trail. -->
<!-- Core Values page, the values are left aligned with only one per line. Cacn we either center or make it something that looks closer to a crest with all four in block formation? (like 2 side-by-side over two lines)
Core Values page, the paragraph inside the blue field has very little room from the left edge and the text, and it looks strange. Can we move it in just a touch? -->
<!-- c -->
<!-- About page, the two bubbles under the titles don?t appear there until after you click somewhere in the individual?s description, then disappear completely when you click in another one, which defeats the purpose of even being able to see them. It?s like only being allowed to see the pages of a book after I?ve read it. -->
